## Overview

### Introduction

This is a solution to the [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).
This project exposes various challenges that need to be addressed to provide a seamless experience for the users, from how to smoothly transition between content when a user clicks on a tab, to reducing the image loading time for a better site performance.
